<h2>TRIBE &amp; TONGUE Vision</h2>
<p>Tribe &amp; Tongue is a global platform that exists to unify the body of Christ from all nations, tribes and tongues as one global Church to bring praise and worship offerings to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
<h2>TRIBE &amp; TONGUE Mission</h2>
<p>The mission of Tribe and Tongue is to create a platform for artists from across the world to collaborate, learn, grow and empower each other. We want to build a community of like minded believers who will hold each other's hands just like Aaron and Hur who held the hands of Moses to lift the banner of Jesus high and bring glory to His Name.</p>
<p>Just as the Scripture says in Rev 7:9,10 that a multitude of believers from every nation, tribe, people and language will stand before the Lord crying out “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb,” we believe that as the Name of Jesus is lifted high through this platform, He will draw people from every tribe, tongue and nation to Himself. We want to see salvation being poured out into the nations through “Tribe and Tongue.”</p>
<p>We want this to be a cross cultural, multi-lingual and diverse platform where artists can foster each other's spiritual gifts to make an impact not just on Christian communities but every community that is in need of Jesus. We believe that as the words from these songs echo in every room, building, community, neighborhood, street and city, the power that is in these words will touch the hearts of people and lead them to Christ.</p>
<p>Our prayer is to see praise and worship songs not being limited to just our homes and Churches but resonated in public places like restaurants, cafes, hospitals, schools, colleges etc.., We believe that God is on the move like never before and in these end times, there is an urgent need to spread the gospel to the perishing and music is one of those important channels through which people can know about Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make my life count for You Lord<br/>
            Make my breath count for You Lord<br/>
            From the time I arise<br/>
            Till the time I rest<br/>
            Make my life count for You Lord</p>
<p>When I lift my voice to sing<br/>
            Make my song count for you Lord<br/>
            Every chord it plays<br/>
            And the sound it makes<br/>
            Make it all count for You Lord</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Key Scriptures for Tribe &amp; Tongue:</h3>
<p><strong>Rev 5:9 (NIV)</strong><br/>
        And they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.”</p>
<p><strong>Rev 7:9-10 (NIV)</strong><br/>
        After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice: “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”</p>

<div class="lyrics">
In Exo:19:4 it says, “You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.”Jesus was faithful then and is faithful now and Aasra Meri reminds us that the same God who has carried us on His wings and brought us this far will continue to carry us further. Even though humans are nothing but dust, He chose us above His glory, lived amongst us, died the death that we deserved and rose up to raise us up from death. What great love! And He promises to be with us till the end of the age and that promise is our hope to press forward in this journey of faith and through trials, to keep declaring His faithfulness. And even in the midst of troubles we can take heart because Jesus has overcome the world.

Yire is a song that talks about the name Yeshua being the fulfillment and embodiment of all the Names of the Father. Jesus is our provider, healer, banner, comforter and promises to be the very present help in time of need. In Prov 18:10 it says, “The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous runs to it and is safe and set on high [far above evil].” Jesus is our unshakable hope and only in Him there is salvation.

Pavitratma is a song of a hungry soul that needs the infilling of the Holy Spirit— a plea to consecrate and sanctify. God has set apart this generation for His glory and the work of the Holy Spirit is so evident amongst us yet there is such a desperation to experience His Presence and a longing to draw near to Him and that can only be satisfied by Him alone who is with us and in us (John 14). As He breathes His wind in our sails and awakens our souls, we will be able rise up, take up our cross, carry the mantle of the gospel and proclaim the Name of Jesus through His power that is at work within us.

Key Scriptures: John 14:15-17, Acts 1:8, Rom 8:11

<div class="lyrics">
Parishudhudu is a song about the One who is Holy, Powerful, Majestic, Glorious, the One who is seated on the throne, the One whom the Heavens & the earth worship, the One who is worthy of it all and the One who reigns from everlasting to everlasting—Jesus Christ. Rev 4 talks about the One saying “and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne….Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: “‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,’ who was, and is, and is to come.” Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say: “You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.” Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. What a mighty God we serve! This song echoes the anthem of Heaven and ushers us into the throneroom of Jesus.

Key Scriptures: Rev 4, Rev 5, Rev 7

Yeshua—The Name above ALL Names, the One who is alive forevermore, the One who is our Heaven, blessing, heartbeat, life, the One who is our light, truth, religion and prayer. There is no one else who is deserving of all our praise and worship except Him who loved us and gave Himself up for us. This song is a declaration of who Jesus is to a believer and confessing that He is God and beside Him there is no other.

Sirf tu hi Khuda
Mauth ko Harakar
Jo Zinda Hua

Rahe Sada
Teri hukumat
Tera Jalal
Tera hi Naam

Yeshua Yeshua
Zinda Khuda…

<div class="lyrics">
Yeshu mein tera is a song of confession. We belong to Jesus, the source of our lives, the One who knew us before we were formed in our mothers womb, chose us before the foundations of the Earth were laid and created us in His image for His purpose &amp; glory. The gift of life is nothing but an offering back unto Him to whom we all belong. This song echoes that very truth over and over again.

Key Scriptures: Ps139, Gen 1, Jer 1, Eph 1:4, Rom 8:35

Chorus: 
Yeshu Mein Tera
Yeshu Mein Tera 
Yeshu Mein Tera
Hamesha ke liye (*2)

V1
Tere Haatho se mujhe hai buna (Ps139)
Tere Saason se mujhe Zinda kiya or (jeevan diya)
Tere roop mein mujhe banaya (Gen 1)
Yeshu Tujme hi mein hoon Basa

Chorus
Yeshu Mein Tera
Yeshu Mein Tera 
Yeshu Mein Tera
Hamesha ke liye (*2)

Maa ke Ghodh Se Hi pehle
Tune Mujhe hai jaana (Jer 1)
Sansar Rachne se Pehle
Yeshu tune hai mujhe chun liya (Eph 1:4)

Honga judha Tere Pyaar se prabhu
Hai koi Nahi Poore Duniya Mein
Jo Mujhe Tujse Alag Kare (*2)
